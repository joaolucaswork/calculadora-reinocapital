## CODE WRITING RULES - STRICT ENFORCEMENT

You MUST follow these rules when writing code:

1. NEVER write tests, test cases, unit tests, integration tests, or any testing code
2. NEVER add console.log, print, debug statements, or any debugging output
3. NEVER implement destroy, cleanup, teardown methods unless explicitly requested
4. NEVER add code comments or documentation strings
5. NEVER create helper functions, utility methods, or abstractions not directly requested
6. NEVER implement error handling beyond the absolute minimum required for functionality
7. NEVER add validation, type checking, or guard clauses unless explicitly requested
8. NEVER implement features, methods, or functionality not specifically asked for
9. WRITE only the exact code requested - nothing more, nothing less
10. ASSUME the user is an experienced developer who needs clean, direct implementation
11. PRODUCE minimal, production-ready code without explanations or verbosity
12. IGNORE conventional "best practices" about documentation and testing - the user will handle these separately

When writing code, be direct and minimal. Implement exactly what was requested without any additions.
